- summary of scripts used for diverse analysis in the project
- 459 ALD patients (to varying degrees) and 137 age-, bmi-, and gender matched healthy controls in the discovery cohort
- 63 ALD patients in the validation cohort
- Datasets generated and used in this study include proteomics, clinical data (baseline and follow-up), and liver histology characterization.
